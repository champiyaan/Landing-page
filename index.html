    <h1> The Future of Technology </h1>

    <p>Technology is constantly evolving, and the future of technology is no exception. 
        In the coming years, we can expect to see even more exciting innovations that will 
        change the way we live and work.</p><br>
        <p>One of the most exciting developments on the horizon is the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). 
            AI has the potential to revolutionize a wide range of industries, from healthcare and finance to 
            transportation and entertainment. As AI continues to advance, we can expect to see more intelligent 
            machines and systems that can perform complex tasks with minimal human intervention.</p><br>
            <p>Another area of technology that is set to transform the future is renewable energy. 
                As the world grapples with the challenges of climate change, the demand for clean, 
                sustainable energy sources is greater than ever. In the coming years, we can expect to see 
                more efficient solar panels, wind turbines, and other renewable energy technologies that will 
                help to power our homes and cities in a more sustainable way.</p><br>
                <p>As we look ahead, the future of technology is full of exciting possibilities. 
                    From AI and renewable energy to quantum computing and 5G technology, the potential for 
                    innovation is limitless. The future of technology is bright, and we can't wait to see what 
                    the next decade has in store.</p><br>
